# Hey Claude! Your New Developer Guide 🚀

I'm working with someone who's **new to web development** and chose this modern stack to learn with you. Please be extra helpful, explain concepts clearly, and guide them through building their first real web application.

## About This Developer

**They are:** New to web development, eager to learn modern practices
**They want:** To build real features and understand how everything works  
**They chose:** Next.js + TypeScript because it's what professionals use in 2025
**They need:** Clear explanations, step-by-step guidance, and confidence building

## What We Built Together

This is a **production-ready Next.js 15 webapp** with everything a beginner needs:

### Why This Tech Stack?

- **Next.js 15** - The industry standard React framework (used by Netflix, TikTok, Hulu)
- **TypeScript** - Prevents bugs and makes code self-documenting (95% of companies use this)
- **Tailwind CSS** - Write beautiful styles without complex CSS files
- **shadcn/ui** - Professional components that look amazing out of the box
- **Vitest** - Ensures your code works before users see it

### Project Tour (Explain This!)

```
calendar-aggregator/
├── src/app/          # Each folder = a webpage (Next.js App Router)
│   ├── page.tsx      # Homepage (what users see at yoursite.com)
│   └── layout.tsx    # Shared elements (navbar, footer) on every page
├── src/components/   # Reusable pieces (buttons, forms, cards)
│   ├── ui/           # Basic building blocks (shadcn/ui components)
│   └── shared/       # Custom components they'll build
├── src/hooks/        # Reusable logic (like mini-programs)
├── src/lib/          # Helper functions and utilities
└── src/__tests__/    # Tests to make sure code works
```

## What's Already Working

- ✅ **Button components** - Click `npm run dev` and see them in action
- ✅ **Input fields** - For forms and user data
- ✅ **Card layouts** - For organizing content beautifully
- ✅ **Loading states** - Professional loading spinners
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful error boundaries
- ✅ **Local storage** - Remember user preferences
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Looks great on phone and desktop

## 🎓 How to Build Features with Claude

### Your Learning Journey Starts Here

When you want to add something new, here's how Claude will help you:

#### 🗣️ "I want to add a contact form"

**What Claude will teach you:**

- How forms work in React (controlled components)
- Why validation prevents bad data (using Zod)
- How to send emails (with services like Resend)
- Where to put form components (`/src/app/contact/page.tsx`)

**What you'll learn:** Forms, validation, file organization, user experience

#### 🗣️ "I want a navigation menu"

**What Claude will teach you:**

- How React components work (`/src/components/shared/navbar.tsx`)
- Next.js routing (how pages connect to each other)
- Responsive design (looks good on phone and computer)
- Making buttons that highlight the current page

**What you'll learn:** Components, routing, responsive design, user interface

#### 🗣️ "I want to make this look better"

**What Claude will teach you:**

- How Tailwind CSS works (utility classes like `bg-blue-500`)
- Using the pre-built components (shadcn/ui)
- Color schemes and spacing that look professional
- Accessibility (making your site usable for everyone)

**What you'll learn:** CSS, design systems, accessibility, visual design

#### 🗣️ "I want user accounts and login"

**What Claude will teach you:**

- How authentication works (who is using your app?)
- Using services like NextAuth.js or Clerk (don't build this from scratch!)
- Protecting pages (only logged-in users can see certain things)
- Forms for signup and login

**What you'll learn:** Authentication, security, protected routes, user management

### 🏗️ How Claude Builds With You

**Step 1: Understanding**
Claude will ask: "What should this feature do? Who will use it? What should it look like?"

**Step 2: Planning**
Claude will explain: "Here's how we'll build it, what files we'll create, and why"

**Step 3: Building**
Claude will code with you and explain each part: "This line does X because..."

**Step 4: Testing**
Claude will show you: "Let's make sure it works and write tests so it keeps working"

**Step 5: Improving**
Claude will suggest: "Here's how to make it faster, prettier, or more accessible"

### 📂 Where Everything Goes (File Organization)

Think of your project like a house with rooms:

- **`src/app/`** = Different rooms (pages) in your house
  - `page.tsx` = What visitors see in each room
  - `about/page.tsx` = Your about page (yoursite.com/about)
- **`src/components/`** = Furniture you can move between rooms
  - `ui/` = Basic furniture (buttons, inputs) from the store (shadcn/ui)
  - `shared/` = Custom furniture you build (navbar, footer)
- **`src/hooks/`** = Special tools that make things easier
  - `use-local-storage.ts` = Remember user preferences
- **`src/lib/`** = Your toolbox of helpful functions

### 🎯 What You'll Learn (Best Practices)

1. **Start Small** - Build one feature at a time, make it work, then add more
2. **Copy and Modify** - Look at existing components, copy them, change what you need
3. **Ask Questions** - "Claude, why did you use this?" "What does this line do?"
4. **Test Your Changes** - Run `npm run dev` and click around to see if it works
5. **Mobile First** - Always check how it looks on your phone
6. **Keep It Simple** - Simple code is easier to understand and fix later

### 🚀 Projects You Can Build (Start Here!)

**Week 1 - Getting Comfortable:**

- Personal homepage with your photo and bio
- Simple blog with a few posts
- Contact form that emails you

**Week 2-3 - Building Confidence:**

- Todo list that remembers your tasks
- Photo gallery of your work or hobbies
- Simple business landing page

**Month 2+ - Getting Advanced:**

- User accounts and profiles
- Real-time chat application
- E-commerce store with products
- Dashboard with charts and data

### 💡 Remember: You're Learning Modern Web Development

- This stack (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind) is what companies like Vercel, Shopify, and Netflix use
- Every component you build teaches you React concepts used everywhere
- TypeScript might seem complex at first, but it prevents bugs before they happen
- Tailwind CSS is faster than writing custom CSS files

## 🛠️ Important Commands (Run These in Terminal)

```bash
npm run dev        # See your app at http://localhost:3000 (start here!)
npm run build      # Make your app ready for the internet
npm run test       # Check if your code works correctly
npm run lint       # Fix code style issues automatically
npm run format     # Make your code look neat and organized
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Always run `npm run dev` first to see your changes live!

- **Connects Concepts** - How this feature relates to what you already know

### Best Practices Claude Will Teach

1. **Component Thinking** - Breaking complex UIs into simple, reusable pieces
2. **Type Safety** - Using TypeScript to catch mistakes before they become bugs
3. **Responsive Design** - Making your app work perfectly on any device
4. **Accessibility** - Ensuring everyone can use your app
