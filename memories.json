AUTO-GENERATED TASK MASTER FILES (~75 files):\n   - .claude/commands/tm/ hierarchy - Task Master command templates\n   - .claude/agents/ - Claude agent definitions\n   - These are framework files, not project-specific code\n\n2. LEGACY CURSOR IDE CONFIG:\n   - .cursor/mcp.json - Old Cursor IDE MCP configuration\n   - Contains placeholder API keys, likely obsolete\n\n3. BUILD ARTIFACTS:\n   - .next/ directory contents (should be in .gitignore)\n   - All build outputs are current from recent builds\n\n4. POTENTIAL MAINTENANCE FILES:\n   - openapi.yaml - Large API documentation (700+ lines)\n   - Multiple schema*.sql files with recent updates\n   - builder.config.json - Simple Vercel config\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- .cursor/mcp.json: PROBABLY_OBSOLETE (Cursor IDE specific)\n- Task Master files: KEEP_FOR_REFERENCE (framework functionality)\n- Build artifacts: Should be in .gitignore\n- OpenAPI spec: KEEP (comprehensive documentation)\n- Schema files: KEEP (active database definitions)\n\nNO TRUE STALE FILES FOUND - Project too recent for 6+ month staleness analysis.",
